                I've enjoyed dabbling in photography as an amateur for a while now. Since moving from 
                Windows to Linux as my daily operating system I've needed too find new software to adapt
                to my hobbies and workflow. Lately, I was interested in finding the new tools to edit 
                photos.

                On Windows, my go to photography software was Canon's Digital Photo Professional software. 
                For those unaware, if you own a canon camera, you will recieve a suite of software with it!
                Unfortunately, none of the software is available outside of Windows and MacOS. After doing 
                my due diligence, I fell in love with the FOSS alternative, Darktables. It feels like a 
                program that is easy to learn but takes years to master.  
                </p>
                <p>
                My camera's raw format is canon's CR3 extension. It's currently not supported on Darktables 
                and posed itself as a potential problem. Luckily, the solution was solved by those that 
                came before me. It seemed the best (while not ideal) solution was to use Adobe's DNG converter 
                software to convert all my images from CR3 to DNG (which can be edited in darktables). 
                You have to use Wine since adobe's software doesn't run native on Linux either but it wasn't
                to bad of a hassle to setup and install.
                </p>
                <p>
                Overall, I'm pretty happy with my new workflow for taking pictures. A lot of time will be spent
                soon learning all the ins-and-outs of darktables!
