                I've enjoyed dabbling in photography as an amateur for a while now. Since moving from 
                Windows to Linux as my daily operating system I've needed to find new software for 
                my hobbies and workflow. Lately, I was interested in finding new tools to edit 
                photos.

                On Windows, my go to photography application was Canon's Digital Photo Professional software. 
                For those unaware, if you own a canon camera, you will recieve a suite of digital tools with it!
                Unfortunately, none of the software is available outside of Windows and MacOS. After doing 
                my due diligence, I was impressed with the FOSS alternative, Darktables. It feels like a 
                program that is easy to learn but takes a while to master.  
                </p>
                <p>
                My camera's raw format is canon's CR3 extension. It's currently not supported on Darktables 
                and posed itself as a potential problem. Luckily, the solution was solved by those that 
                came before me. It seemed the best while not ideal solution was to use Adobe's DNG converter 
                software to convert all my images from CR3 to DNG ,which can be edited in Darktables. 
                You have to use Wine since Adobe's program doesn't run native on Linux either. Overall, it wasn't
                to bad of a hassle to setup and install.
                </p>
                <p>
                In conclusion, I'm pretty happy with my new workflow for taking pictures. A lot of time will be spent
                learning all the ins-and-outs of Darktables!
