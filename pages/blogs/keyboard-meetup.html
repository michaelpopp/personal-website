                I'm quite a big fan of keyboards. I'm really happy that many others around myself are as well.
                One of the best experiences with any hobby is too find other like minded individuals within 
                and have a good time.

                December 5th, 2021 marks my third keyboard meetup. The venue was at a coffee shop/roaster in 
                the Houston area. Approximatly fourty to fifty people attended in total. I went with my wife Emily
                and my good friend Ivan. Emily and I brought our M60 and 7V, while Ivan brought his first 
                custom-board. When we arrived we found a table to setup all our gear and hanged out for a couple
                hours! I found the shop's lattes too be very tasty as well!
