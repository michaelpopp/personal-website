This repository contains all assets and source code that I use on my website.
Feel free too study, modify or use my code for your own use.

I decided too focus primarily on HTML and CSS for a couple of reasons.
  
Firstly, I wanted my webpage's to be very small in terms of size. 
I like the idea the no matter your internet-speed or bandwidth, my
site would load fast (this is also the reason I have minimal/no JavaScript)!
Secondly, any addition frameworks such as bootstrap or react are unnecessary 
in this context and would only add additional overhead.

Thank you for taking the time to read!
