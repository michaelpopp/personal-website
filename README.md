# portfolio-website
This repository contains all assets and source code that I use on my website.
Feel free too study, modify or use my code for your own use.

I decided too focus primarily on HTML and CSS for a couple of reasons.
  
Firstly, I wanted a my webpage's too be very small in terms of size. 
I like the idea the no matter your internet speed or bandwidth, my
site would load fast(this is also the reason I have minimal/no JavaScript)!
Secondly, any addition frameworks such as bootstrap or react are unnecessary 
and would only add additional overhead.
